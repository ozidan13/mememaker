# Mememaker App Development Roadmap

This document outlines a step-by-step plan to build a simple, professional, and user-friendly mememaker app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app will allow users to upload images, add/edit/delete text overlays, reposition texts via drag-and-drop, and view created memes in a hero section with popup functionality for downloads. The app is targeted at Arabic users and will incorporate the Tajawal font (or a similar font) along with Font Awesome for icons.

## 1. Define Requirements & Scope

### Core Features
- **Image Upload:** Allow users to upload an image.
- **Text Overlays:** Enable adding between 1 to 5 text blocks (with the ability to add more via an "Add Text" button).
- **Text Editing:** Provide options to delete individual text blocks.
- **Drag-and-Drop:** Allow users to reposition text anywhere on the image.
- **Meme Display:** Created memes are displayed in a hero section; no extra titles or tags.
- **Popup Modal:** Clicking on a meme opens a modal for an enlarged view with a download icon (from Font Awesome).

### Additional Considerations
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure the app works well on both desktops and mobile devices.
- **Arabic Typography:** Use Tajawal or a similarly appealing Arabic font.
- **Minimal & Professional UI:** Design a clean, intuitive interface.

  - Design the popup modal for the enlarged meme view and download functionality.
- **User Flow:**
  1. Upload an image.
  2. Add, move, or delete text overlays.
  3. Save and display the meme.
  4. Click on a meme to view it in a popup and download.
